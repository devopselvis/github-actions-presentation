# GitHub Actions Presentation Demos

The following are the demos either contained in this repo, or that in part use this repo.

## Basic GitHub Actions Demos

These demos are used to provide a basic overview of GitHub Actions.  The demos may be shown in any order, and do not rely on any previous demo.  The order below starts with the most simple workflow, and builds to a real-world example.

| Demo | Overview |
| ---- | -------- |
| Basic Workflow | This demo consists of a simple GitHub Actions workflow. It covers the basics to understand how GitHub Actions works. |
| Chaining Jobs| This demo shows what happens when you have multiple jobs in a workflow file. It shows how you can control the order the jobs work in, and how to use conditional statements to control when a job runs. | 
| Variables | This demo shows you some of the different ways to work with variables, including job, step, and environment variables. It also shows you how to access the GitHub context object
| A Real World Demo | This demo is a real world example of using GitHub Actions. It makes use of multiple workflows. There is a workflow that runs on a pull request to main, that ensures the code builds and test pass before the pull request can be merged. There is a workflow that runs on a push to main, which makes use of GitHub environments, and deploys the code to multiple Azure App Services.
