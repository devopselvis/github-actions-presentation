# Changes are coming

I am updating as well as cleaning up some of the workflows in this repo, and adding new demos as well.  As such, it is going to be a little chaotic around here right now.  For example, I am going to create a BACKUP folder, and I'm gonna move old files there, just to make it easy for people to find them.  

Please bear with me.
## Resetting the demo env:

git reset --hard <the latest version>
git push --force
